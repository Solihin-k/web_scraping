# Description
Job hunting is one of the most tedious and exhausting things to do. It involves more than searching for open positions and sending your resume to employers. You also need to make sure you’re a good fit for the job, can catch the hiring manager’s attention and are well-prepared to answer interview questions.

The web scraper will help shorten the time taken to search for open positions and also identify some keywords via a wordcloud based on the job description. Hopefully this can help you by freeing up some time to focus on your resume and subsequent follow-ups.
The main URL is set to search for data related jobs in Singapore, but can easily be customised for any positions at any locations.
